# My Portfolio

I built this portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. It serves as a central hub for my work, designed to be both visually striking and highly functional.

## Tech Stack

I chose a modern and performant stack to build this Application:
- **React**: For building a component-based UI.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS (v4)**: For rapid, utility-first styling with the new `@theme` configuration.
- **Framer Motion**: To bring the interface to life with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Vite**: For a lightning-fast development environment and optimized production builds.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for all device sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom animations, hover effects, and a custom cursor.
- **Dynamic Content**: Sections for Projects, Skills, and Experience.
- **Modern Aesthetic**: A "Persian & Sand" color theme with glassmorphism effects.
